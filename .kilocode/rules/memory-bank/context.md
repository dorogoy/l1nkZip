# Context

## Current work focus
Maintaining and improving the L1nkZip URL shortener API. The project is currently at version 0.4.4 and appears to be in a stable production state.

## Recent changes
- Updated dependencies including Ruff, FastAPI, Jinja2, and other core packages
- **Replaced mypy with ty for type checking** and updated linting configuration
- Added health check endpoint and database connection testing
- Improved error handling and stability
- Implemented rate limiting protection using slowapi to prevent abuse through mass URL creation and enumeration attacks
- Added optional Redis caching for improved performance on frequently accessed URLs
- **Implemented comprehensive monitoring and observability** with Prometheus metrics, structured logging, and alerting support
- Added `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus scraping with 10+ metric types
- Integrated metrics collection into URL creation and redirect endpoints
- Added structured JSON logging with configurable format and levels
- Created comprehensive test suite for metrics functionality
- **Replaced inconsistent print() statements with proper structured logging** across all modules (cache.py, main.py, generator.py)
- **Created centralized logging module** with JSON and text formatters supporting configurable log levels
- **Enhanced error logging consistency** with contextual information and proper log levels (ERROR, WARNING, DEBUG)

## Next steps
- Continue dependency updates and security patches
- Consider adding additional features based on user feedback
- Maintain documentation and deployment examples
- Monitor performance and scalability for the public API using new observability features
- Documented the official CLI companion project (l1nkzip-cli) in the main repository
- Set up production monitoring dashboards and alerting rules
- Evaluate monitoring effectiveness and adjust thresholds as needed
- Consider implementing distributed tracing for complex request flows

## Recent test fixes (August 2025)
- **Fixed test suite execution issues**: Modified Makefile to run tests separately (unit, integration, API) to avoid test collisions and state leakage between different test types
- **Resolved caching integration test failures**: Fixed issues with database session/transaction management when Redis was enabled in tests
- **Fixed redirect test issues**: Updated tests to use `follow_redirects=False` to properly test redirect responses
- **Fixed performance test assertion**: Updated cache performance test to use appropriate timing assertions for mocked Redis environment
- **All tests now pass**: 54 unit tests, 61 API tests (6 skipped), and 36 integration tests (2 skipped) are passing
